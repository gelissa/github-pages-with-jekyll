# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. 

My name is Gelissa and I'm interested in a lot of things but they are centralized around....

words and their aesthetic qualities. 

In this blog, I hope to dump all my research and interesting junk while I learn about contemporary art, typography, and other theory. Hopefully....I mainly talk and think about movies as well, but that's for something else.
